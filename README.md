This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## My Portfolio
This portfolio was a course I downloaded on Udemy.  The reason I opted to go this route was because I wanted to incorporate bootstrap, Github as well as React to get the feel for how things work.  There were also some CSS elements that I really liked and wanted to learn.  The downside to the tutorials is it's monkey pushes buttons.  Obviously it's faster to copy someones template vs learning on your own and creating from scratch, but the learning isn't as solid.  Still, there's something to be said for repetition, playing with the CSS elements and making them your own, as well figuring out why code isn't working because it's dated (as happaned in my react-hook-form section). 

### Strengths

This section was "Services" in the tutorial, but as I'm not building a web page to sell my talents, I had to come up with something else because I liked the section and the web page would feel a little more empty

### Bio

I thought that it was really neat how he made the timeline.  That and the <Particle> effect were two things that drew me to this particular project.  As my web dev experience is null, I tried to make it a least interesting to read to help punch up the portfolio a bit.

### Portfolio
  
Pretty void at the moment, and there's a wordpress site that seems a little basic.  I started working on the later just to gain experience while I tried to get my shell path sordid out.  I'm having issues everywhere but no that I at least have a basic portfolio up and running, I can get back to doing some NodeJS experience working with APIs (which I really enjoy). I'm also thinking about adding the Udemy JS projects I've done with the disclaimer that they are more monkey pushing button projects.  But the instructor is good, makes it a point to issue challanges and I was often trying to figure out code first before it was explained.
