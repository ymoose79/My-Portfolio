This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## My Portfolio
This portfolio was a course I downloaded on Udemy.  The reason I opted to go this route was because I wanted to incorporate bootstrap, Github as well as React to get the feel for how things work.  There were also some CSS elements that I really liked and wanted to learn.  The downside to the tutorials is it's monkey pushes buttons. 
I made some design choices, had to work from the docs as react-hook-form was deprecated.  After adding newest MERN stack project (airbnb spoof), I refactored my Portfolio section/created new component because the code was getting unwieldy.  I'll also thank myself next time I change/add a new project.

### Strengths

This section was "Services" in the tutorial, but as I'm not building a web page to sell my talents, I had to come up with something else because I liked the section and the web page would feel a little more empty.  These are technologies that I've touched and have exposure to, but as I'm a little over a year into this web-dev world, by no means am I trying to pass myself off as an expert.

### Bio

I thought that it was really neat how he made the timeline.  That and the <Particle> effect were two things that drew me to this particular project.  As my web dev experience is null, I tried to make it a least interesting to read to help punch up the portfolio a bit.

### Portfolio
  
Pretty void at the moment, and there's a wordpress site that seems a little basic.  I started working on the later just to gain experience while I tried to get my shell path sorted out.  I've included a svelte todo list project and will include a "buggy" svelte CRUD application, just to show that I have experience working with databases.
